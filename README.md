# Capstone_Chatbot
Executive Summary
The " ParkLink's Chatbot " project aimed to elevate customer engagement at Precise ParkLink's parking kiosks by implementing a sophisticated chatbot solution. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of user-kiosk interactions, our approach involved the development of two key models.
The first model, an intent-based neural network, focused on answering common questions from Precise ParkLink's FAQ database, achieving an accuracy of 98% on the training set and around 83% on validation dataset. The second model, a generative transformer-based architecture, handled more open-ended inquiries and casual conversations.
Challenges were addressed, such as compatibility issues between TensorFlow versions for the two models. A solution was devised by creating a wrapper for the generative model, and deployment was streamlined using a Django API. The chatbot, seamlessly integrated into the parking kiosk system, now contributes to a more personalized and efficient user experience.
Looking forward, the project suggests potential enhancements for the chatbot, emphasizing the continuous evolution of this technology. Overall, this initiative represents a significant advancement for Precise ParkLink, showcasing the transformative power of leveraging historical data to enhance customerÂ interactions.
